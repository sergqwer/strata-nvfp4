// kernels (ggml-cuda mmq.cuh, MIT): the weights stay quantized and the activations are rounded to q8_1, the
// products run on int8 tensor cores.  The dequantize-to-FP16 + cuBLAS path wrote ~10 MB of FP16 per expert and
// multiplied in FP16; this reads the ~1.4-2 MB expert once.  A group of experts is gathered into one buffer
// (`gather_*`, one launch per expert as its blob arrives) and multiplied in one launch per product.
